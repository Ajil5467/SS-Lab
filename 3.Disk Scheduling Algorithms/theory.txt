One of the responsibilities of the operating system is to use the hardware efficiently. For the disk drives, 
meeting this responsibility entails having fast access time and large disk bandwidth.
 Both the access time and the bandwidth can be improved by managing the order in which disk I/O requests
 are serviced which is called as disk scheduling. The simplest form of disk scheduling is, of course, 
the first-come, first- served (FCFS) algorithm. This algorithm is intrinsically fair, but it generally 
does not provide the fastest service. In the SCAN algorithm, the disk arm starts at one end, and moves 
towards the other end, servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder, until it gets to the other end of 
the disk. At the other end, the direction of head movement is reversed, and servicing continues. The head 
continuously scans back and forth across the disk. C-SCAN is a variant of SCAN designed to provide a more
 uniform wait time. Like SCAN, C-SCAN moves the head from one end of the disk to the other, servicing 
requests along the way. When the head reaches the other end, however, it immediately returns to the
 beginning of the disk without servicing any requests on the return trip.
