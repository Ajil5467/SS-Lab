1. Open and Read the input
  file
2. If the input line has 
 the opcode “START” do the following
2.1 Find if there is any operand 
 field after “START”, initialize 
 the LOCCTR
to the operand value
2.2 Otherwise if there is no
 value in the operand field then
 LOCCTR is set to zero
3. Write the input line to 
 the intermediate file
4. Do the following steps 
 until the opcode is END
	4.1 Check the Symbol table, 
	 if the symbol is not available then
	 enter that symbol into the SYMTAB, 
	 along with the memory address in which
	 it is stored.Otherwise, the error message 
	 should be displayed
	4.2 If there is a opcode
	    4.2.1 If opcode is present in the
	    OPTAB, then increment the LOCCTR by 3
	   4.2.2 If opcode is “WORD”,
 	   then increment LOCCTR by 3;
	   4.2.3 If opcode is “BYTE”,
	   then increment LOCCTR by 1;
	  4.2.4 If opcode is “RESW” then 
	  increment LOCCTR by the integer 
	  equivalent of the operand value * 3; 
 	  4.2.5 If opcode is “RESB”, then
	  increment LOCCTR by the integer equivalent
	 of the operand value
	4.3 Write the processed lines 
	in the intermediate file along
	 with their locationcounters
5. To find the length of the program,
 Subtract the starting address of the 
 program from the final value of the LOCCTR
6. Close all the files and exit
