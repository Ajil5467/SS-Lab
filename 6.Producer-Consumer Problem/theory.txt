Producer-consumer problem, is a 
common paradigm for cooperating
 processes. A producer process 
produces information that is 
consumed by a consumer process.
 One solution to the 
producer-consumer problem uses 
shared memory. To allow producer
 and consumer processes to run
 concurrently, there must be
 available a buffer of items that
 can be filled by the producer 
and emptied by the consumer.
 This buffer will reside 
in a region of memory that is 
shared by the producer and 
consumer processes. A producer 
can produce one item while the 
consumer is consuming another 
item. The producer and consumer 
must be synchronized, so that
 the consumer does not try to
 consume an item that has not 
yet been produced.
