1. Open and read the first line from
 the intermediate file.

2. If the first line contains the
 opcode “START”, then write the label,
 opcode and operand field values of
 the corresponding statement directly
 to the final output file.

3. Do the following steps, until 
 an “END” statement is reached.

	3.1 Start writing the location 
	 counter, opcode and operand 
	 fields of the
	 Corresponding statement 
	 to the output file, along with
	 the object code.

	3.2 If there is no symbol/label in
	  the operand field, then the operand
	 address is assigned as zero and it is
	 assembled with the object code of
	  the instruction.

	3.3 If the opcode is BYTE, WORD, 
	RESB etc convert the constants to
	 the object code.

4. Close the files and exit.
