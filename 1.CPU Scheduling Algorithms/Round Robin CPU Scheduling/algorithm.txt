ROUND ROBIN CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

For round robin scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system, their CPU burst times, 
and the size of the time slice. Time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order,
 handling all processes execution. This allows every process to get an equal chance. Calculate the waiting time and 
turnaround time of each of the processes accordingly.



Algorithm : Round robin scheduling

Step 1 : for each process do
Step 2 : Read bursttime for processes
Step 3 : Read time quanta(time inteval) and call it interval
Step 4 : Create a circular queue and call it readyq 
Step 5 : Insert all processes in their order to readyq 
Step 6 : repeat
Step 7 : Remove first element from readyq and call it P 
Step 8 : set P.bursttime = max(0, P.bursttime âˆ’ interval) 
Step 9 : if P.bursttime 6= 0 then 
Step 10 : put P to the end of readyq
Step 11 : until readyq is empty
