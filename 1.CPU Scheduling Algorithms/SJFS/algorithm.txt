SJF CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

For SJF scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system, their CPU burst times.
 Arrange all the jobs in order with respect to their burst times. 
There may be two jobs in queue with the same execution time, and then FCFS approach is to be performed.
 Each process will be executed according to the length of its burst time.
Then calculate the waiting time and turnaround time of each of the processes accordingly.

Algorithm : SJF scheduling nonpreemptive

Step 1 : for each process do
Step 2 : Read bursttime 
Step 3 :Read arrivaltime 
Step 4 : Read priority
Step 5 : Sort processes based on arrivaltime and then by bursttime
Step 6 : Create a queue and call it readyq
Step 7 : Insert all sorted processes in their order to readyq
Step 8 : repeat
Step 9 : Remove first element from readyq and call it P Step 10 : set P.bursttime = 0
Step 11 : until readyq is empty
