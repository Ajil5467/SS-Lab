1.2.1 FCFS CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

For FCFS scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system, their CPU burst times. The scheduling is performed on
the basis of arrival time of the processes irrespective of their other parameters. Each process will be executed according to its 
arrival time. Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time of each of the processes accordingly.


Algorithm : FCFS nonpreemptive

Step 1 : for each process do
Step 2 : Read burst time 
Step 3 : Read arrival time
Step 4 : Read priority
Step 5 : Sort processes based on arrivaltime
Step 6 : Create a queue and call it readyq
Step 7 : Insert all sorted processes in their order to readyq
Step 8 : repeat
Step 9 : Remove first element from readyq and call it P Step 10 : set P.bursttime = 0
Step 11 : until readyq is empty
